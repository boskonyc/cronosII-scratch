	* Message Transfer Widget: Created the arrows (RGB and yellow).
			We are now ready to code the c2_pop3_fetchmail
			and this widget should already be prepared to
			show what's going on (through signals).
	* POP3 module: Welcome function, log-in, status request.
	* Preferences: Fixed the problem that made that when you edit an
			account the username appear empty and the password with the
			username on it (actually, the fix was in the Account module,
			but the preferences module was where you could see it).
