= About this version =
======================
Cronos II 0.2.3 (aka "New light") is a reborn of the project,
since Cronos II is growing and is getting bigger, and when I started
this project I didn't have any experience at all, it bases weren't
as strong as they are required  for such a big project as this is.
Basically, this version is more than just a *recode*, is a restructuring
of Cronos II, now the main source of Cronos II is separated from
the modules which interact with certain tasks.
Also, with this version, the manual I wrote (actually just
in CVS under the directory /documentation) titled "Cronos II Development manual"
is to start being used, so everyone of us code with the same things
in mind: modularity and speed.

The users will also see many changes in Cronos II:
o Ability to change the interface without getting mess with the code (through Glade);
o IMAP support;
o Spool (local mbox) support is totally different now;
o HTML support;
o and more.

In the same directory you will find Instructions on using CVS for CronosII Developers,
a quick manual that Peter Gossner wrote.
