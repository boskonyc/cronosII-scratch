= About this version =
======================
Cronos II 0.2.3 (aka "Welcome to the real world") is a reborn of the project,
since Cronos II is growing and is getting bigger, and when the it started
this project I didn't have any experience at all, it basics weren't
as strong as they are required to be for such a big project as this
is, thus why this version introduces nothing really new for the
end user, but introduces a LOT of changes for us, developers.
Basically, this version is more than just a *recode*, is a restructuring
of Cronos II, now the main source of Cronos II is separated from
the modules which interact with certain tasks.
Also, with this version, the manual I wrote (actually just
in CVS under the directory /documentation) titled "Cronos II Development manual"
is to start being used, so everyone of us code with the same things
in mind: modularity and speed.

 In the same directory you will find Instructions on using CVS for CronosII Developers.
