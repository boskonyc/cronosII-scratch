= About this version =
======================
Since Cronos II is growing and is getting bigger, and when I started
this project I didn't have any experience at all, it basis weren't
as strong as they are required to be for such a big project as this
is, thus why this version introduces nothing really new for the
end user, but introduces a LOT of changes for us, developers.
Basically, this version is more than just a *recode*, is a restructuration
of Cronos II, now the main source of Cronos II is separated from
the modules which interact with certain tasks.
Also, with this version, the manual I wrote (actually just
in CVS under the directory /documentation) titled "Cronos II Development manual"
is to start being used, so everyone of us code with the same things
in mind: modularity and speed.
