This file is to explain the emoticons:
All images created with gimp at 16 pixels by 16 pixels.
Each image saved in xpm and png for GTK and Gnome use.
Images built from the ASCII string with some small modifications for clarity only.
(no art involved here)
I checked the emoticons at various sites about the net. " google emoticons".

File		=	ASCII string

emoticon-angry1	=	:-||
emoticon-laugh	=	:D
emoticon-sad	=	:(
