This file is to explain the emoticons:
All images created with gimp at 16 pixels by 16 pixels.
Each image saved in xpm and png for GTK and Gnome use.
***No longer is xpm built by default however if we move away (back) to a pure gtk appthen we will need to convert these to xpm at least until gtk2 is stable.***
Images built from the ASCII string with some small modifications for clarity only.
(no art involved here)
I checked the emoticons at various sites about the net. " google emoticons".
please see the change log for the latest news.
