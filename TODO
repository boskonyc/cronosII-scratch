configure.in:
			o Check for libglade-gnome: it is required to build.

art work:
			o Build own icons (for all buttons and menu items).
			o Build IMAP mailbox icons, Cronos II mailbox icons and Spool mailbox icons.
			o Do a :) and a :D face in 10x10 pixels.
	
widget-mail:
			o Italic is not recognized/translated.

dialogs:
			o Add mailbox dialog: redisign it, is not intuitive enough, use the
			  mailbox list widget.
			o Add a new dialog that will popup when a new version is installed,
			  which tells the user what has changed since the previous version
			  s/he was using.

supports:
			o MH mailbox.
			o Themes.

backends:
			o An efficient hash object for IMAP (must be faster/lighter than Gtk's).
			o Create some kind of IPC in the application widget to make it
			  listen for actions like separated processes fireing a composer,
			  or a main window.
			o Add a new member to the C2Db object: C2Db *parent: this way
			  we can implement message threading in the db module itself!
			o It would be nice for message threading to be able to access
			  message-id of messages in a fast way, thus why I think
			  the db-cronosII submodule needs to store the message-id of each
			  message in the master file of the database.

more:
			o Check TODO.CVS for more TODO's!! :)
