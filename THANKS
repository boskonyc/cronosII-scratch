I want to add one more person to this THANKS file. Actually
I want to add THREE persons to this file.

First of all I want to give thanks to the person I fall
so deeply in love. The woman who will be the mother of
my children, the person who I want to live the rest of
my life with. The girl that makes me smile every time
I think of her. The beeing that makes me flush every time
I hear her voice. Mariana Parola, my wife, my daughter,
my sister, my place and my everything.

Sweet baby, I love you, and I'll always be there for you,
holding you, and loving you.

I also want to thank my very best friends: Victoria Ventura
and Soledad Filgueira, I love you girls!

I really miss you, the three of you.

								El Nuevo Pablo.

There are many people that I, Pablo, want to thank, I hope
the rest of the team gives thanks to everyone they like,
even if they didn't help with something related to Cronos II,
as I'm doing here.

Ok, I want to give thanks to my friend Yves Mettier, who
didn't just show me Paris, the best city ever, but also
introduce me to many of his really cool friends, I'll
try to name you guys, but I know nothing about french
and my memory sucks ;) Amelie, Nico, Sophie, Philippe
and the rest (yeah, ok, these are the one who I chat
the most or that kept better in 1k memory up there in
my head).

I also want to thank the many people I met in my trip
around Europe: specially Sarah, Liz, Sergio, and even those
who I never knew their names. I also want to say thanks
to that really beautiful girl I met in Rome, Cecilia,
she was from Salta (Argentina), I know it is quite
impossible for you to read this, anyway, you are here.. :)

My sister and my brother in law deserve to be thanked for
giving me a place to stay in Spain and for showing
me Ibiza. Also for letting me crash again at ther place.

I also want to thank each city, for teaching me something,
everyone of you gave me something, and I appreciate it.

I want to say thanks too to my parent who help me paying
my trip around Europe and always trusted in my.

And, at last, but not least, I want to thank my partners at the
Cronos II Hackers Team, without them this release
would never happen, specially the one who worked a lot
along me: Bosko.

Oh, just one more thing, I want to thank YOU for reading
until here, thats something that surprise me :)
