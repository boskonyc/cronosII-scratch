There are many people that I, Pablo, want to thank, I hope
the rest of the team gives thanks to everyone they like,
even if they didn't help with something related to Cronos II,
as I'm doing here.

Ok, I want to give thanks to my friend Yves Mettier, who
didn't just show me Paris, the best city ever, but also
introduce me to many of his really cool friends, I'll
try to name you guys, but I know nothing about french
and my memory sucks ;) Amelie, Nico, Sophie, Philippe
and the rest (yeah, ok, these are the one who I chat
the most or that kept better in 1k memory up there in
my head).

I also want to thank the many people I met in my trip
around Europe: Sarah, Liz, Sergio, and even those
who I never knew their names.

My sister and her boyfriend deserve to be thanked for
giving me a place to stay in Spain and for showing
me Ibiza.

I also want to thank each city, for teaching me something,
everyone of you gave me something, and I appreciate it.

I want to say thanks too to my parent who help me paying
my trip around Europe.

And, at the last, I want to thank my partners at the
Cronos II Development Team, without them this release
would never happen.

Oh, just one more thing, I want to thank YOU for reading
until here, thats something that surprise me :)
until here, thats something that surprise me :)
