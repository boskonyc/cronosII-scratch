Now you need to enter your Username at the Mail Server. (try the account name)</para>
<para>The following Toggle Button enables Secure Server Layer (SSL) modes. (You should know about this if you need it.)</para>
<para>Finally choose an Authentication method. This is so the Server knows it is you calling. The password is entered later and is the password given to you by your ISP or Systems Administrator. Currently there is Password and APOP. </para>
