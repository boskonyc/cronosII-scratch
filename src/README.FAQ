Q: What's the difference between main-window.{ch} and c2-main-window.{ch}?
A: main-window.{ch} stores the functions that handles nearly all callbacks for
   the main window and the function that creates the main window.
   c2-main-window.{ch} stores the callbacks for the main window that will
   create a dialog or some kind of UI interaction (except for minimal changes
   like a c2_app_report) and also stores the function that should also get called
   outside of {c2-}main-window.c.
