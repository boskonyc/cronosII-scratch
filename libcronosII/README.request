The request module will use, by now, the gnome-download
program, distributed with gnome-core (>= 1.2, < 1.2?)
since Http is giving me to much problems and I don't have so much
time to waste with it.

Future versions (probably before Cronos II Scratch becomes Cronos II)
should recode it to use the internal functions and take care of
everything on its own.
