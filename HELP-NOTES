This file won't ship with Cronos II,
is just a couple of notes added that
should be noted to when writing the
user manual, so, basically, this are
notes for Pete :)

NOTE: This notes SHOULD NOT be quoted
since they might be written in a too
casual way, the point of the notes
is so the writter of the help system
knows about "obscure" functions of
Cronos II that are not too obvious.

NOTE: This notes SHOULD NOT be only
in CVS, this are NOT notes for users.

------------------------------------------

1. Preferences » Interface » HTML » "Interpret text/plain symbols"
   This option causes Cronos II to search, when displaying
   text/plain messages, for symbols that are commonly used
   to express some kind 

2. How can I do to make Cronos II my default e-mail client?
   (for stuff like responding to mailto: links)

   You have to open the Control Center, then go to
   Documents Handlers » URL Handlers
   And write in the text entry in the top of the page the following:

   +------------+          +---------------------------------------+ +-----+ +--------+
   | mailto:    | handler: | cronosII -l "%s"                      | ||Set|| ||Remove||
   +------------+          +---------------------------------------+ +-----+ +--------+
                             ^^^^^^^^ By now the binary is actually cronosII-scratch,
							          but when stable is released it will change to
									  cronosII.

   After writing that you have to click the "Set" button.

   Note that not all browsers support this, I know Galeon does,
   so Yves and I won't have problems (yes, we both use it).

   Pete, maybe you can research a little, I know that in [fmII]
   there're programs that make Netscape answer to mailto: links
   with external commands.
